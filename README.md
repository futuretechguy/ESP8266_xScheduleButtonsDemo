# ESP8266_xScheduleButtonsDemo_v2

This is the modified sketch for the xLights xScheduler interactive button build that shows how to construct a prop for engaging an audience, it allows someone to manually move backward or forward through a music/light show sequence by selecting a "Back" or "Next" button, and to use other buttons to trigger useful show control actions using the Arduino and xScheduler.

This version of the project code is based on the work from Wendell Seaton's very good build video and code updates for the wireless Arduino (below), and is used to drive my many buttoned marquee. This version incorporates some lessons learned and provides additional commentary in the code.
